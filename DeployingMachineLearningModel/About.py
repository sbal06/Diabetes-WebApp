About the two models:
- DiaAidâ€™s Machine Learning Model was trained on the publicly available Mendeley Diabetes Dataset. The data is originally from the Iraqi society, which was acquired from the laboratory of Medical City Hospital and the Specialized Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes-Al-Kindi Hospital. The Mendeley Dataset contained 1000 data entries and 14 column values: ID, gender, age, urea value, creatinine ratio(Cr), hemoglobin A1C, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, VLDL, BMI, and an output class (diabetes, predict-diabetes, or not diabetic). All data besides the patient number and ID was utilized in the training of the model since it is not relevant to the prediction of diabetes.
- To enhance accessibility, we have also engineered a Research-Based Model in Python that evaluates the inputs of day-to-day terminologies. We examined the most common and impactful risk factors of type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes, and we valued this model as accurate according to the test trial by the 2Life Communities at Brighton, MA. 

Results of both models will be presented in four categories: low, medium, high, and very high risks. 
The Research Based Model will predict one of the above four classes for three types of diabetes - Type 1, Type 2, Gestational Diabetes.

However, it should not be considered a replacement for actual blood tests in diagnosing diabetes or substituting medical advice. This research-based machine learning model is not FDA-approved and may contain inaccuracies. Furthermore, the machine learning model was trained using a dataset of 1000 data entries and was not continuously trained on private data, which may introduce additional inaccuracies. DiaAid also acknowledges the diversity of race, ethnicity, and gender, but due to simplicity, these factors are constrained in our model. We understand that user inputs are personal and confidential.
